## Description

A simple MERN stack application for a Complete Spotify clone with backend build with Node.js
A feature that I wished to implement was of a feed where users can comment on what other people are listening to on a real time basis and add features like commenting on a particular time stamp of a particular song.
Unfortunately I couldn't implement it because the approach I was following, went against the terms of use of the Spotify API.
